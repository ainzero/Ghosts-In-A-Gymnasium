Ghosts in A Gymnasium

Gameplay: Before the game starts, the player has the opportunity to move 
blocks (Chairs) around anyway he or she wishes. Once finished, two 
Ghosts will spawn, along with three mice. The player must kill mice and 
feed the ghosts to buy time before they catch him or her. The ghosts 
will move fast enough before the first feeding where they will catch the 
player. Gaining time for yourself involves feeding the ghosts without 
being eaten by them. The goal in the game is to see how long you can 
survive 
without being eaten. 

Code Notes:

Theres some needless duplication and inefficency here and there, mainly 
because I just 
wanted to get something working.

game.py - main game object, runs game. 

Ghostman,Mouse,Player - objects pertaining to given name

Sprite Data:

  /data/sprites/<spritename>/<action i,e stand,walk 
etc>/<direction>/<spritename>0.png for first frame of animation, 1 for

TODO:

better collision detection between sprites
enhanced pathfinding for ghosts and mice, taking into account chairs
